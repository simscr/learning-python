## Introduction

Here are some references that I am going to start with:

-   [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)

    -   [GitHub Repo with Data](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book)

-   [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

-   [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

-   [NumPy Exercises](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/)

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# print("Hello world")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
